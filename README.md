# Device drivers in Rust and a RAG

Linus Torvalds said "Unless something odd happens, it [Rust] will make it into 6.1."

This is on going developement of divice drivers in RUST the book that I am taking help from is (https://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/)

Built following drivers
- Hello world driver
- Module parameter driver
- scull driver
- jit driver
- Block device driver
- tty device driver
- currently working on PCI driver

Realise that gpt has some blind spot for rust so also working on the RAG
